This first week what I have been doing is the following:

1. Read documentation (previous master's tesis related to Robotics-Academy based, for example, in visual autolocalization with markers, robotic vacuums, etc.). 
2. Do the Color Filter exercise of Robotics-Academy, that can be found in this [link](https://jderobot.github.io/RoboticsAcademy/exercises/ComputerVision/color_filter). The exercise itself is easy to solve, this is just an "excuse" to start working with the interface of Robotics-Academy. The goal of this exercise is to track an object aplying a color filter, preferably in the HSV color space. It is necesary to port to map the port where the camera is located to the docker container. For Windows, it is necesary to do some steps in order to map the webcam's port. These steps are describe in [documentation](https://medium.com/@jijupax/connect-the-webcam-to-docker-on-mac-or-windows-51d894c44468). 
During the week, I have tried to connect the webcam with the docker container but I haven't been able to do it. I'll try to solve it next week!
